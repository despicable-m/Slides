# Slides overview 

This web app was written in Python - using Django framework - on the back end and Javacript, HTML and CSS on the front end. The app allows users - students - to upload course materials and make announcements that can only be seen by users in the same university and in some cases, only users who are reading the same program as the uploader in the same university.

## Registration
All users are supposed to open an account (register) before they can upload or access anything. During registration, users are asked to select their university, school (department), program and level from a list added to the database by a site admin.

## Homepage
After registration, users are logged in and redirected to the homepage where they have access to up to five recent announcements for students in the user's university, five recently uploaded documents specific to the user's level and course, courses specific to the user's level and program, and levels. The user can view more annoucements, uploaded documents and courses by click or tapping on the view all button adjacent to each category.

User can make announcments or uploads files, one at a time, by clicking on the relevant nav-link on the navigation bar.

# Why the restrictions?
While the restrictions make sure that users are not overwhelmed by too many documents and announcements that are not relevant to them, the restrictions also make sure that some documents that some lecturers might not want distributed outside the university do not get distributed outside the university.
